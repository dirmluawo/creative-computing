            <h1>Community</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Our tight-knit community is the core of our success. The Parsons Scholars Program takes pride in creating a supportive space that stems from a deep mutual respect across staff, students, faculty and mentors. This bond often lasts well beyond high school graduation, and the majority of our alumni stay involved as mentors-- sometimes returning as guest speakers and in a few cases as youth advocates and faculty. We all benefit from a space that recognizes the importance of our identities as people of color, people from low income backgrounds and first generation college students. We find strength in acknowledging the obstacles and the beauty associated with these identities.</p>

            <h1>Resources</h1>
            <br>
            <p>The Parsons Scholars Program recognizes that we are one of the only — if not the only— space where students from underrepresented backgrounds are exploring art and design as a potential educational and career path while explicitly exploring the role our identities play in those paths. We currently accept twenty four Scholars per year out of 100+ applicants, and are committed to maintaining our program at a size that allows for close personal interaction. We are also committed to providing public programming and resources for the hundreds of incredible youth from NYC public schools we have the fortune of meeting during our application cycle. As co-founding members of Art Future NYC, the Parsons Scholars Program collaborates with organizations such as Joan Mitchell Foundation and Ashcan Studio to create events for students such as Portfolio Redefined, Art Degree Demystified, and the Careers in the Arts Fair, and the NYC Portfolio Summit for educators and art school admissions reps. We are also proud to be a resource for industry professionals who are enthusiastic about our mission.

                <div class="carousel-cell first"><h1>Jose Bautista</h1> <br> <p>I’m a junior in high school also in the Parsons Scholars Program. This program gave me another way to stay out the streets and to stay on track with myself. This program helps me be more social with people and also it had gave me so much more knowledge than just school things I learned a lot of life lessons.  I thank the advocates and the mentors I am given because they really want me to be successful and they want me to be ahead of them when I’m their age. This program also mentally made me stronger because of my fellow scholars, they really like a whole new family I have now. Blah blah blah thank you for having me explain why parsons scholars program helped me.</p></div>
                <div class="carousel-cell second"><h1>Dirm Luawo</h1> <br> <p>I currently work as a mentor for the Junior cohorts in the program. I started the program in early 2015 and I’ve been with the program since. As a scholar, I was extremely grateful for all the things the program had to offer. I was strategic in using the resources that were provided for me to benefit myself and others while I was in high school. While I was already attending a specialized art school in Manhattan, I was able to bring in the skills I learned into the program and develop myself as a person and artist. As I coast through my undergrad, I continue to be active with the community that has helped me into this school as well as students who would benefit from what I have to offer.</p></div>
                <div class="carousel-cell third"><h1>John Edwards</h1> <br> <p>As a low-income student, my ability to experience new fields of art were always limited. Classes were out of the questions as costs were too high for frequent attendance. However, through the Parsons Scholars Program, I’ve been given the opportunity to further my pursuit towards a career in animation while preventing any economic strain on my mother. With the advice and insight from my mentors and advocates, my idea for the future has become dramatically more refined. I now also have exponentially more connections and possibilities available.
                    My gratitude towards the program and all involved cannot be expressed enough.</p></div>
                <div class="carousel-cell fouth"><h1>Richard Valentine</h1> <br> <p>I am a former scholar and I currently attend Purchase college. I benefited greatly from Parsons Scholars Program. When I got into high school I was never sure what I wanted to do after high school let alone college. I didn’t know what I was looking for. I found solace in the program amongst my peers and mentors guiding me and supporting me along the way. The program taught me how to find my own style and become a successful artist. I do not study art today however I still keep practicing keeping the advice I’ve been given along the way with me. I’ve grown as a person throughout the three years in this program.</p></bbr></div>
